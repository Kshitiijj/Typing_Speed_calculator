# Typing_Speed_calculator

The aim of this project is to create a typing speed calculator that measures the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

Description
This project involves developing a Python program that prompts the user to type a given set of words or sentences. The program records the time taken to complete the typing and calculates the typing speed in WPM. Additionally, it provides feedback on the user's accuracy and speed.

The user interface is created using the Tkinter library. The program displays a prompt text that the user needs to type. As the user starts typing, the program begins recording the time. Once the user submits the typed text, the program calculates the time taken, the number of words typed, the WPM, and the typing accuracy. These results are then displayed to the user.

Technologies
Python: The core programming language used to implement the logic and functionalities.
Tkinter: A standard GUI library in Python used for creating the graphical user interface.
Time: The Python time module is used to measure the time taken for typing.
Learning Outcomes
From this project, I learned:

User Input Handling: How to capture and handle user input in Python using the Tkinter library.
Time Measurement: How to measure and calculate the time taken for a task using the time module in Python.
Basic GUI Design: How to design and implement a basic graphical user interface using Tkinter, including creating and arranging widgets like labels, text areas, and buttons.
String Manipulation: How to process and compare strings to calculate accuracy by comparing the typed text with the prompt text.
Feedback Mechanism: How to provide meaningful feedback to the user based on their typing speed and accuracy.
